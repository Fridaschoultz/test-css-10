                    born and I will give

                    truth, the
                    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
                    is pleasure, but
                    because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                    extremely painful. Nor
                    again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
                    but because
                    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take
                    a trivial example,
                    which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
                    But who has any right
                    to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
                    who avoids a pain
                    that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
